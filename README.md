# OTFS w/ Realistic Pulse Shapes Simulator (MATLAB)
A MATLAB simulator for calculating error rates in orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation, using realistic pulse shapes (rectangular/sinc/rrc).

## Instructions
To use this code, you should (probably) run it in MATLAB 2024b or higher. You may need to create some folders for it to work, but I think I made create commands for all of them.

For any questions please contact jrwimer@uark.edu.
